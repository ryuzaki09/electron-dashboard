### Electron App Template

This app template includes:

- Electron
- React
- Typescript
- Express
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Mocha
- Spectron

To run the app, enter:

```
npm run go
```

#### Run Tests

To run the unit test

```
npm test
```

To run the acceptance test

```
npm run test:acceptance
```

Spectron does not work with es6. Therefore there is a build of the app before running the acceptance test.
